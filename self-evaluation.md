# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method? I feel pretty good about it. It's fun!

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? I think I had a bit of productive struggle, but everything was fairly easy to find on the web and I think it wasn't too terribly hard.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? I feel pretty confident with what I've learned so far. I'm not sure there's anything I feel I need to adjust.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? No questions yet!!
